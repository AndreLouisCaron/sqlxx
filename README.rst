  ``sqlxx``: type-safe C++ wrappers for ODBC C API.
####################################################

:author: Andr√© Caron (andre.l.caron@gmail.com)

Introduction
============

The ``sqlxx`` project is a C++ software library that wraps the cumbersome ODBC
C API in the hope of providing a high-quality SQL experience in small C++
applications.

The primary goal is to provide a light-weight database interface that supports:

#. prepared statements; and
#. transactions.

The project should be freely available and compile from source using CMake_ and
be usable as a Git_ submodule.

.. _CMake: http://www.cmake.org/
.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/

Project state
-------------

This project should still be considered experimental.  The author uses it in
one small production application but not all features are guaranteed to be
production-ready.

The API documentation will be made available online shortly.


Getting started
===============

Compiling
---------

0. Get the source code.

   ::

      git clone git://github.com/AndreLouisCaron/sqlxx.git
      cd sqlxx

1. Read the licence.

   It's BSD, but you're still required to read and understand the license terms
   before starting to use the code.

2. Generate build scripts.

   ::

      mkdir work
      cd work
      cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

   If you prefer to use Visual Studio, generate a solution using one of the
   Visual Studio solution generators built-in to CMake.  Type ``cmake`` on
   the command line for a list of supported Visual Studio versions.

3. Compile the libraries and demo projects.

   ::

      nmake

   If you generated Visual Studio solution instead of the Makefiles, start
   Visual Studio, open the solution and build the project (``Ctrl+Shift+B``
   hotkey).

4. Build the API documentation.

   ::

      nmake help

5. Run the test suite.

   ::

      nmake /a test

Embedding
---------

The ``sqlixx`` library is designed for embedding in other CMake-based (and
Git-based) projects.  When built as a dependency, the test suite, tools and
documentation are not automatically compiled, thus accelerating the build.

0. Prepare your project for Git submodules.

   ::

      cd my-project
      git submodule init

1. Embed ``sqlxx`` as a Git submodule.

   ::

      mkdir libs
      git submodule add git://github.com/AndreLouisCaron/sqlxx.git libs/sqlxx

2. Refer to the ``sqlxx`` library in your root ``CMakeLists.txt``.

   ::

      set(sqlxx_DIR
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/sqlxx
      )
      find_package(sqlxx
        REQUIRED
      )
      include_directories(${sqlxx_include_dirs})

      # Use "sqlxx" target for resolving dependencies and "${sqlxx_libraries}"
      # to link against "sqlxx" and its dependencies (native ODBC C library).

Contributing
------------

If you wish to hack on ``sqlxx``, you may want to build in debug mode and
compile the full API documentation:

::

   git clone git://github.com/AndreLouisCaron/sqlxx.git
   cd sqlxx

   mkdir work
   cd work
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

   nmake
   nmake help
